# IsOrderedExtender
An extension method written in C# to verify whether an IEnumerable is ordered

The important part is the method "IsOrdered" located in class "Extenders" in the project "ExtenderLibrary".
The rest is just demonstration and testing code.

Use IsOrdered in your code by applying it as an extension method to any IEnumerable that contains IComparable members.
See examples in main.cs as well as in the Unit Tests.
